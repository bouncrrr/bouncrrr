            <img src="#" alt="Placeholder image for what bouncrrr does"class=" placeholder-image"> <!-- Replace # with your image URL -->
            <p>bouncrrr automates the process of bouncing stems in logic pro, saving producers, engineers, and artists hours (or even DAYS) of manual work.</p>

            <h2>how does it do it?</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="Placeholder image for how does it do it" placeholder-image"> <!-- Replace # with your image URL -->
            <p>bouncrrr uses a complex code to automate the process, bouncing each stem one by one.</p>

        <section id="setup">
            <h2>how much setup do i need to do?</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="Placeholder image for setup" placeholder-image"> <!-- Replace # with your image URL -->
            <p>the setup for bouncrrr is minimal, involving a small preparation process for each project.</p>

            <h2>is this just another gimmick that isn't really going to work?</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="Placeholder image for reliability" placeholder-image"> <!-- Replace # with your image URL -->
            <p>a lot of time and effort has gone specifically into making sure that bouncrrr is reliable and doesn't crash. if the bouncing process gets knocked off course, you'll be alerted and given the option to resume from where you left off. bouncrrr was created by a producer and mix engineer who was fed up of half solutions and false promises, so reliability was a priority.</p>
