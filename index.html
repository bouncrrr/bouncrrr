            <p>a lot of time and effort has gone specifically into making sure that bouncrrr is reliable and doesn't crash.</p>
<p>if the bouncing process gets knocked off course, you'll be alerted and given the option to resume from where you left off.</p>
<p>bouncrrr was created by a producer and mix engineer who was fed up of half solutions and false promises, so reliability was a priority.</p>
